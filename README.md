Introduction
The boat and slip API models a basic pier, where boats move in and out of slips. Each slip can only have one boat at a time. Basic commands include POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. Detailed boat and slip API documentation and the supported endpoints can be found in the API Description.pdf document. 

Google App Engine and Amazon Web Services were used in the deployment of the application and the creation of the database schema. 

To Run 
Before running the code, npm install should be executed, and Node.js version 8 should also be installed. The main program is in main.js.

The URL for the API is https://boatapi-210218.appspot.com/, and requires one of the supported endpoints (as described in API Description.pdf). There is no home page.
